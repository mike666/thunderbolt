thunderbolt
===========

Thunderbolt is a small program I started to write that generates structured xml files from lots of static web site. The website 'http://markprindle.com' host music reviews made up of static content, this program crawls through the website and fetches all the metadata such as artist title, albums title, rating, and review text. The aim was to provide a way  to export the data for distribution such as feeds etc.
